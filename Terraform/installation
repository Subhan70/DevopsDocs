Terraform: it is an infrastructre as a code, i.e is managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of using manual process to configure th
Features: 
  --> uses HCL language 
  --> this is not integrated with any cloud platform
  --> we can use or integrate with any cloud platform by providing the required providers
  --> can be included in ci/cd as well.
  
Architecture: main.tf file (where we mention all the configuration details)

for installing terraform we need to download the terraform exe file
https://www.terraform.io/



after this in cmd search for terraform version --> if this shows that this is not an internal command then set the env variables path 

  --> we can use terraform for better suggestions by installing the plugin in vs code
  
for running the script we have mainly 4 commands which we use --> there are other commands as well 
  1. terraform init   --> it initilazes the project (creates a directory in .terraform/plugins/registery.terraform.io
  2. terraform paln   --> will check any other resource groups or any other are involved or not(basically shows a dry run for us) 
  3. terraform apply  --> after perfroming dry run it creates the required source or shows error if any occurs.
  4. terraform delete --> to delete the resources
  
 tfstate file -->we store our data i.e ip's and other things 
   --> if multiple dev are using tfstate files the we store our tfstate file in our backend i.e in our blobstorage/git repo/s3
